Generally, the bug type is MALFUNCTION, CRASH, PERFORMANCE or SECURITY.<br>\n<br>\n<b>CRITICAL</b><br>\nIssues that prevent the user from completing the main tasks, often resulting in a system crash.

They could be overlapping elements, wrong contrast, incoherent elements, cut or blurry text or media, elements that are either out of the screen or partially not visible/overlapped.<br>\n<br>\n<b>PERFORMANCE</b><br>\nIssues strictly related to the contents load speed or the completion time processes/actions (lag, slowing down, delays). In the case of a never-ending loading (loop), the correct bug type is CRASH.<br>\n<br>\n<b>MALFUNCTION</b><br>\nIssues related to a wrong functioning or non functioning feature of the product. When the feature works, but the result is different from what the user expected, the bug type is USABILITY.<br>\n<br>\n<b>TYPO</b><br>\nIssues related to grammar mistakes such as spelling, semantics, lexicon, syntax, interrupted sentences (not a visual interruption), wrong or incomplete translations, nonsense sentences, visible programming code.<br>\n<br>\n<b>OTHER</b><br>\nIssues not listed in the previous categories.<br>\n<br>\n<b>SECURITY</b><br>\nIssues solely related to the security and confidentiality of the stored data.
